/// Main API for controlling pins
///
/// `Pin` has two type parameters:
/// - `T`, to indicate which specific pin this instance of `Pin` represents
///   ([`PIO0_0`], [`PIO0_1`], and so on).
/// - `S`, to indicate which state the represented pin is currently in.
///
/// A pin instance can be in one of the following states:
/// - [`state::Unused`], to indicate that the pin is currently not used.
/// - [`state::Swm`], to indicate that the pin is available for switch
///   matrix function assignment.
/// - [`state::Analog`], to indicate that the pin is being used for analog
///   input.
///
/// A pin that is in the GPIO state is represented by its own struct,
/// [`GpioPin`].
///
/// # State Management
///
/// All pins start out in their initial state, as defined in the user manual. To
/// prevent the user from making a mistake, only the methods that induce a valid
/// state transition are available. Code that tries to call a method that would
/// cause an invalid state transition will simply not compile:
///
/// ``` no_run
/// # use lpc8xx_hal::Peripherals;
/// #
/// # let mut p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
/// #
/// # let mut syscon = p.SYSCON.split();
/// # let mut swm = p.SWM.split();
/// #
/// # #[cfg(feature = "82x")]
/// # let mut swm_handle = swm.handle;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "845")]
/// # let mut swm_handle = swm.handle.enable(&mut syscon.handle);
/// #
/// // Assign a function to a pin
/// let (clkout, pio0_12) = swm.movable_functions.clkout.assign(
///     p.pins.pio0_12.into_swm_pin(),
///     &mut swm_handle,
/// );
///
/// // As long as a function is assigned, we can't use the pin for general-
/// // purpose I/O. Therefore the following method call would cause a compile-
/// // time error.
/// // let pio0_12 = pio0_12.into_input_pin(&p.GPIO);
/// ```
///
/// To use the pin in the above example for GPIO, we first have to unassign the
/// movable function and transition the pin to the unused state:
///
/// ``` no_run
/// # use lpc8xx_hal::Peripherals;
/// #
/// # let mut p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
/// #
/// # let mut syscon = p.SYSCON.split();
/// # let mut swm = p.SWM.split();
/// #
/// # #[cfg(feature = "82x")]
/// # let mut swm_handle = swm.handle;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "845")]
/// # let mut swm_handle = swm.handle.enable(&mut syscon.handle);
/// #
/// # let (clkout, pio0_12) = swm.movable_functions.clkout.assign(
/// #     p.pins.pio0_12.into_swm_pin(),
/// #     &mut swm_handle,
/// # );
/// #
/// # #[cfg(feature = "82x")]
/// # let gpio = p.GPIO;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "845")]
/// # let gpio = p.GPIO.enable(&mut syscon.handle);
///
/// let (clkout, pio0_12) = clkout.unassign(pio0_12, &mut swm_handle);
/// let pio0_12 = pio0_12.into_unused_pin();
///
/// // Now we can transition the pin into a GPIO state.
/// let pio0_12 = pio0_12.into_input_pin(gpio.tokens.pio0_12);
/// ```
///
/// # General Purpose I/O
///
/// All pins can be used for general-purpose I/O (GPIO), meaning they can be
/// used for reading digital input signals and writing digital output signals.
/// To set up a pin for GPIO use, you need to call [`Pin::into_input_pin`] or
/// [`Pin::into_output_pin`] when it is in its unused state.
///
/// This will return a [`GpioPin`], which provides the GPIO API.
///
/// # Fixed and Movable Functions
///
/// Besides general-purpose I/O, pins can be used for a number of more
/// specialized functions. Some of those can be used only on one specific pin
/// (fixed functions), others can be assigned to any pin (movable functions).
///
/// Before you can assign any functions to a pin, you need to transition it from
/// the unused state to the SWM state using [`Pin::into_swm_pin`].
///
/// ``` no_run
/// # use lpc8xx_hal::Peripherals;
/// #
/// # let p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
/// #
/// let pin = p.pins.pio0_12
///     .into_swm_pin();
///
/// // Functions can be assigned now using the SWM API
/// ```
///
/// As mentioned above, a function can be fixed or movable. But there is also
/// another distinction: Functions can be input or output functions. Any number
/// of input functions can be assigned to a pin at the same time, but at most
/// one output function can be assigned to a pin at once (see user manual,
/// section 7.4). These rules are enforced by the API at compile time.
///
/// **NOTE:** There is some uncertainty about whether those rules treat GPIO as
/// just another kind of function, or if they don't apply to it. Currently, this
/// API treats GPIO as something entirely different from the switch matrix
/// functions, which may be too restrictive. If you have any insight on this
/// topic, [please help us figure this out](https://github.com/lpc-rs/lpc8xx-hal/issues/44).
///
/// Once a pin is in the SWM state, you can assign functions to it. Please refer
/// to the [SWM API] for more information on how to do that.
///
/// # Analog Input
///
/// To use a pin for analog input, you need to assign an ADC function:
///
/// ``` no_run
/// use lpc8xx_hal::Peripherals;
///
/// let p = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
///
/// let mut syscon = p.SYSCON.split();
/// let mut swm = p.SWM.split();
///
/// #[cfg(feature = "82x")]
/// let mut swm_handle = swm.handle;
/// #[cfg(feature = "845")]
/// let mut swm_handle = swm.handle.enable(&mut syscon.handle);
///
/// // Transition pin to ADC state
/// let (adc_2, pio0_14) = swm.fixed_functions.adc_2.assign(
///     p.pins.pio0_14.into_swm_pin(),
///     &mut swm_handle,
/// );
