# LPC8xx HAL [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/lpc8xx-hal.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/lpc8xx-hal) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/lpc8xx-hal/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/lpc8xx-hal) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lpc-rs/lpc8xx-hal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lpc-rs/lpc8xx-hal)

## Introduction

Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the [NXP LPC800] series of microcontrollers, written in the [Rust] programming language. The [LPC82x] and [LPC845] are currently supported. LPC8xx HAL provides a high-level interface to the features of LPC800 MCUs, that is safe, convenient, and efficient.

LPC8xx HAL leverages Rust's type system to prevent common mistakes. Things like attempting to use a peripheral that has not been properly initialized, or attempting to assign conflicting functions to the same pin, will all result in compile-time errors.

This crate is an implementation of [embedded-hal]. Please consider if you can make your code platform-independent, by depending on [embedded-hal] instead of this library.

## Status

LPC82x HAL is still under heavy development. It is lacking APIs for many peripherals, and the APIs that already exist are mostly incomplete.

**Do you need a feature that is currently missing? Please [open an issue]!**

The existing APIs are expected to evolve significantly in the future. API stability is *not* guaranteed, which means future versions might not be compatible with code using the current version.


## Usage

To include LPC8xx HAL in you project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

``` toml
[dependencies]
lpc8xx-hal = "0.9"
```

If you want to use LPC8xx HAL in an application (as opposed to a library), there are additional things that need to be set up. Please refer to the [API Reference] for details.

To run one of the examples from this repository, please adapt the following command if you're using an LPC845-BRK board:
```
cargo embed lpc845 --example gpio_delay --features 845-rt
```

Or adapt the following command if using an LPCXpresso824-MAX board:
```
cargo embed lpc82x --example gpio_delay --features 82x-rt
```


## Documentation

The **[API Reference]** should contain everything you need to use this library. If you think that anything's missing, please [open an issue].

For functionality that is not yet covered by this crate, you may need to fall back to [`lpc82x-pac`]/[`lpc845-pac`]. Please refer to their respective documentation if necessary.

The authoritative source on the supported MCUs are their respective user manuals, available from NXP.
